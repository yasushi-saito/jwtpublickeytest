# jwtpublickeytest

Example of signing and verifying JWT with EC384 private/public key pairs.

The key generator is written in both Go and Terraform.

The signer is in Go. The verifier is in Go and Python.

Run:

    # Generate a new public/private keys under keys/*.pem
    # Sign a small key and verify it.
    go run . -generate-random-keys

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Decode the data generated by the previous run of main.go
    python3 ./jwttest.py


    # A similar test, but generate public/private keys using terraform and
    # ./main.tf
    go run . -terraform
    # Decode the data generated by the previous run of main.go
    python3 ./jwttest.py
